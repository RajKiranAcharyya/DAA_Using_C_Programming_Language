# DAA_Using_C_Programming_Language

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of programs and assignments related to **Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA)**, implemented using the C programming language. It serves as a practical reference for students and developers learning core algorithmic techniques and their applications in solving computational problems.

## Description

The aim of this repository is to provide simple, well-documented C programs that demonstrate various algorithmic strategies such as:
- **Divide and Conquer**
- **Greedy Algorithms**
- **Dynamic Programming**
- **Backtracking**
- **Graph Algorithms**

Each program corresponds to a commonly taught topic in a typical DAA course and can be used for academic practice, lab assignments, or interview preparation.

This collection is especially helpful for:
- Engineering students studying DAA
- Anyone preparing for technical interviews
- Educators seeking ready-made examples for teaching
